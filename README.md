This is a drum kit built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to play sounds by clicking on the buttons or using your keyboard to enter specific keys.

The project helped me develop my skills in working with the Document Object Model (DOM) and JavaScript. Throughout the project, I learned how to use the forEach loop to iterate through a list, implement decision-making using the switch statement, and add event listeners such as keypress and click.

Overall, building this drum kit enhanced my understanding of DOM manipulation and expanded my knowledge of JavaScript.
